# Neural-Style-Transfer
The Neural Style Transfer algorithm created by [Gatys et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
For most of algorithm such face recognition we optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. With Neural Style Transfer, we'll get to optimize a cost function to get pixel values.
